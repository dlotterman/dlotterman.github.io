The Bitly Tech Podcast was exactly what you think it was and was choice little piece of content, that has since been abandoned / unmaintaned. [This](https://word.bitly.com/post/116917905082/introducing-the-bitly-tech-podcast) is the link to the podcast annoucenment post, and this is the internet archive page for the episode where the host (the excellent [Seaon O'Connor](https://twitter.com/theseanoc?lang=en)) and I have a conversation about oncall, filers and keeping a [P.M.A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_mental_attitude) in the crucible of outages. [The podcast is still hosted by Apple here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-1-staying-alive/id986808888?i=1000340169239).
