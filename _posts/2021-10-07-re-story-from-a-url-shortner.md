 *This is a rehost of a [LinkedIn Article I published](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/re-jesss-story-from-url-shortner-dan-lotterman/?trackingId=hGFEu89yRLq%2FPDPLEHswTw%3D%3D) on the platform in October of 2021. I’m rehosting it here for my own context and control.*

I don't know that I've felt as "professional life" angry after reading Jess's story at [Bitly](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitly/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BcjUabSgoRxyY2GyXVe4SMQ%3D%3D) as since the anger I felt that led me to leave Bitly in 2016.

I should clarify here that do not have any active connections to Bitly, I do not know Jess or any specifics of anyone referenced directly in the story. I do not know the facts of this story. I only know what was in the story as it was written on LinkedIn, and that as far as I’m aware, there has been no [transparent](https://bitly.com/blog/) response from [Bitly](https://twitter.com/Bitly) yet.

After three days to "sleep on it and see," I'm still so mad after reading Jess's story of her experience at Bitly I still can't think straight. I don't think I have been this "professional life" angry since the anger I felt that led me to leave Bitly back in 2016, where I was Lead DevOps Engineer at the time.

Every day it feels like we learn of a new story of people in the industry who "look like me" shuffling their boots on the necks of people who don't "look like me." By "look like me" I mean look like me, Dan Lotterman. Again and again, not enough of the people who “look like me,” who helped build these broken systems in the first place, speak up. I'm sick of it.

A contractor and I lifted together to hang the [TV that’s pictured](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQFzVm4qWPcjlw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1633377534762?e=1636588800&v=beta&t=eMp9NewGnAYBsEhOWzvoO9PATAVWsMsxxqSJdnD9ayA) in Jess's story, which is in the Bitly NYC office. I re-terminated the jack below the TV more times than I can count because it just refused to play nice. I put together those desks and wired their electrical boxes together after midnight because we were already days late on our scheduled return to office deadline. That picture makes me so angry I still feel nauseous thinking about it.

To Jess,  I promise we weren't trying to build this when we were there. I promise we were trying to build something better, where things like this wouldn't happen, which may just show my naivety.  I'm so sorry for my participation in building something that did what it did to you and other people. I wish you peace, strength, and healing.

To the people who participated in, enabled, laughed at, supported, or protected the behavior detailed in Jess's story, you are a cancer on the goodness of people. You are a malignant tumor on the body of human progress. You are weak and pathetic. I pray that you find the courage to look inside yourselves and find why it is you feel the need to put someone else down in an attempt to make yourselves feel better. Shame on you.

To anyone who does business with people who were in “key to this story” leadership roles at Bitly in February of 2020, don't do business with them.  For some, this is representative of their track record, this is what they do. Do not invest in them, do not hire them, do not partner with them, or else this will inevitably be your brand too. They are feckless, selfish, mean, vain, and without a professional moral center.

If I could quit Bitly a second time, I would. Once, however, was enough.
