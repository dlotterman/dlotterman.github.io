While working at [Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com/), in conjunction with the [Field CTO](https://metal.equinix.com/blog/author/my-truong/) and marketing team (who did all of the hard work), I co-authord a [blog post on the value](https://metal.equinix.com/blog/crank-it-fmax-single-threaded-performance-tuning/) of modern CPU TDP and frequency management in modern workloads, especially in performance sensitive cloud workloads like blockchain and data centric products.

There is *consequence* in understanding what level of abstraction you specifically derive value from as an operator. The performance implications of shedding abstraction are real, and sometimes kinda nifty.
